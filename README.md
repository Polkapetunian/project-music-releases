# Music Releases
The focus on this project was to practice using React components and to build a page which shows new albums and singles. The music-release data comes from a downloaded response from the Spotify API.


## The problem

We were 3 people working on this project together. We used pair-programming and did not divide the work amongst us. We started to plan the project in Trello. We used map() to display the proper parts of the data like the album-cover-image, the artists name and the album name. We used flexbox to create a responsive design. We find inspiration to solve our problems by looking at stackOverflow and Github.
